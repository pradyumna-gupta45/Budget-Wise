# Budget-Wise
Help track your spending and alert you when you've reached your limit!
A chrome extension to accept users' spendings, display current total spending tally, set a spending limit, and notify the user if that limit is reached; as well as an options page to reset the total and limit.

Right click on the extension icon to open the options page and set your spending limit.

You can also add to your total spending tally by highlighting the price of your purchase, anywhere in the browser, and selecting "SpendMoney" from the right-click menu. Total expenditure at any time is always visible as a badge on the extension's icon.

On the options page you can also reset your total spending tally to zero whenever you wish.
